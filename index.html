            <h2>Why we go out of our way to help</h2>
            <p>
              We condemn the lack of respect and safety for girl children and refuse to stand by as they are constantly
              treated like third-class citizens. So, we act for these reasons.

            <div class="card reason">
              <h4>No Health Benefit</h4>
              <p>
                The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, as
                well as cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and newborn deaths. It can also lead
                to increased risks of HIV transmission.

            <div class="card reason">
              <h4>Forced Marriage Is Abuse</h4>
              <p>
                Child and forced marriage(CFM) ends childhood abruptly. It also adversely affects children's rights to
                education, health, and protection, and puts them at risk of violence, exploitation, and abuse. These
                consequences affect not only the girl but also her family and community.

            <div class="card reason">
              <h4>Psychological Impact</h4>
              <p>
                It can have psychological impacts in several ways, from a girl losing trust in her caregivers and
                parents to longer-term feelings of anxiety and depression. Thereby putting her at risk of suicide.

              We think that girls' voices can drive change, not just in the future but also in the here and now. Our
              programming strategy gives young girls all around the world the power to make the choices that will affect

                FGM discussion is a vital part of our community, but only the testimony of the impacted women can convey

                      they would always wait for him to be out of town for work before they'd take us. I heard from a
                      relative that when my older sister and I were taken, my dad and uncle tried to press charges
                      against the family members who did it. But instead, they had a community meeting and settled on,
                      "What's done is done." I hope that some day soon, I will be able to talk to my dad about what

                      She cannot have kids as a result of her FGM. I have two daughters now and had to be cut open again
                      to have each one. But I had them here, with a doctor. Back in Gambia, I could have died. My girls

                      survivors of FGM to have a safe place to go to without being judged. I also want a reconstructive

                    me to the midwife who lives a few streets away. Then they cut me again; and this time, the woman who
                    operated on me made sure that I was closed. It is years later now. The doctors told me that I could
                    never have children because of the infibulation. Therefore, no one will marry me; no one wants a
                    wife who cannot have a child. I sit at home alone and I cry a lot. I look at my mother and my aunts,
                    and I ask them: â€™Why did you do this terrible thing to me?â€™.
