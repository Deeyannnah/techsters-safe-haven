                  For over 5years, Safe Haven has successfully transformed 10,000 young womens life across west africa
                  from not having a choice and voice to speaking and standing for theirselves again gender mutilationa
                  and forced marriage. It was a challenge for us at first due to the rate at which the practice was in
                  the west african region. Of cause we didn't do it alone, we had support from individuals and companies
                  who share the same interest as us to carry out this mission and we are forever grateful for the
                  support. Below are amazing stories from young women who have benefited from the foundation.

              <p>
                Rukia stands tall with confidence. A traditional beaded Maasai headpiece drapes down from the crown of
                her head, and her bold, beaded necklace reads: “Stop FGM.” She’s a leader in her community and a women’s
                rights advocate, and her journey here has been against all odds.” I was only 10 or 11 years old, when my
                father decided to circumcise me. I was to become the fifth wife to a 70-year-old man. I talked to my
                class teacher and she informed the police chief. Just two hours before the cutting ceremony, the police
                came and took me away,” she recalls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rukia was the first girl in her village to say no to FGM.In the eight years that followed, Rukia lived
                in a rescue center where safe haven provided far from all that was familiar. “The hardest thing for me
                was leaving home, leaving my family. I couldn’t sleep…I would wake up in the middle of the night and
                think, should I go back and get FGM?” she says.
              </p>

              <p>
                For rukia and thousands of girls with similar stories, her escape impacted her family dynamics, and the
                consequences weighed heavy on her shoulders. “Finishing school was a crucial step in Rukia’s journey
                because it allowed her to define her own path. Today, Rukia works with an anti-FGM Board to help raise
                awareness in local villages about the harmful consequences of the traditional practice.

                Joy is seventeen years old. She takes extra classes at school, preparing for secondary school exams and
                serves as Head Girl at the safe house in Serengeti, where she fled to escape FGM.Joy reached out safe
                haven to help her out. “Many girls flee their homes with nothing more than the clothes they were
                wearing,” says Kiwori, head matron of the safe house.
              </p>

              <p>
                The home has ten rooms, each with four bunk-beds and small cubbies to store personal items. It was built
                to accommodate 40 girls but has sheltered over 300 during the “high season”, when the Kurya tribe, the
                predominant indigenous tribe in Mara, performs FGM.Through safe haven many girls like joy are able to
                find safe houses and continue with their education.

              <p>
                As a social worker and rural woman leader in Upper Egypt, Halima goes to work each day for the rights
                and wellbeing of girls and women. She fights for their access to education, their right to give full
                consent before marriage and their entitlement to a life free of FGM and other harmful practices. Growing
                up, Halima loved learning. After graduating high school, she was eager to continue her studies but
                wasn’t allowed to make the decision for herself.
              </p>

              <p>
                “It is difficult for a girl to continue her education in Upper Egypt,” Halima says. “I finished my [high
                school] diploma but could not take my education any further as my parents decided that a diploma was
                enough. My brothers also did not support the idea of educating the girls of the family,” she explains.
                She married at age 18. “When I got married I wanted to devote my energy to work but my husband kept
                saying that my house and children are my job,” recalls Halima. Eventually, with the support of safe
                haven, she began working in a nursery, and several years later, after rigorous studying and
                examinations, Halima was hired by the Ministry of Social Solidarity as a social worker.

              <p class="text-left">
                Neema is a renowned activist, UN Women ambassador for Africa, a mother and a survivor of FGM. At 15
                years old, she fled home in search of a safe place away from her family who wanted her to get married
                after undergoing FGM. Neema got a scholarship to study abroad through safe haven travelled to New York
                City there after she found a good man to marry.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was then that she realized she had undergone FGM as a baby. “There are four types of FGM; I went
                through “Type 3”, which is the total removal of the clitoris, and the labia and the vagina are stitched
                together with only a small hole to urinate and menstruate. I realized that my marriage could not be
                consummated till I was defibrillated. “When she became pregnant, Neem began anonymously speaking out
                about FGM. “I knew that I don’t want my daughter to go through that.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also knew that there are millions of girls out there that are just like my daughter and no one was
                speaking up for them. And if it wasn’t me, then who else? “Propelled by her deeply personal relationship
                to the issue, Neema’s anonymous advocacy soon grew to world-shaking shouts. “I screamed out against FGM
                and child marriage, wrote blogs, threatened to call law enforcement if I could not leave my husband,
                established an NGO to combat these practices and petitioned the Obama administration to investigate the
                profile of FGM in the United States of America.”

              <p>
                It was a difficult decision, but I am happy because I don’t think FGM could make me happier than my
                education,” Dabin* (15).Dabin, 15, is a fierce leader, a child activist and an example in her community
                and school. Five years ago, she refused to stay silent when she learned that her mother was planning for
                her to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM).As in many other communities in Sierra Leone, FGM is
                deeply-rooted in the Kabombeh community, to which Marie belongs.
              </p>

              <p>
                The practice can cause lasting harm, including pain, infection, internal bleeding, psychological
                repercussions and complications during child birth. FGM can even be fatal. As Dabin had learned about
                these consequences from village activists, she refused to undergo the procedure. However, this meant she
                would have to leave home and seek help. Fortunately, after Marie left home, she ran into someone who
                told her about safe haven, which agreed to support her. “If I hadn’t had support, especially from safe
                haven, things could have gone wrong for me and it would’ve remained with me for the rest of my life,”
                she says.
